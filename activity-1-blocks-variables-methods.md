# Activity 1 : Blocks
* Define a class called Test.java
* Add main method.
* Write System.out.println statement inside method with some message.
* Define 2 static blocks with some statements inside it.
* Define 2 static blocks with some staement inside it.
* Create object of Test class inside main method using new. Run the Test class. See the output.
```

```
# Activity 2 : Static Methods
* Define a class called Test.java
* Define main method.
* Define 2 static methods called as m1() and m2() with both having void return type. Add some statements in both of the methods.
* Call m1() from m2()
* From main method call m1() without creating object.
* Add a static block. call m1() from static block without using object. verify the output.
# Activity 3 : Non Static Methods
* Define a class called Test.java
* Define main method.
* Define 2 non-static methods called as m1() and m2() with both having void retunr type. Ass some statements in both of the methods.
* call m1() from m2().
* Inside main method create object of Test using new. Test var = new Test().
* using above reference variable of Test call m1()
* Add a non static block. call m1() from non static block. verify the outout.
# Activity 4 : Parameterized Methods
* Define a class called Test.java
* Define a main method.
* Create a static method sum(int x, int y) and having return type as int. This should give sum of x + y
* Call sum(10, 20) from main method and print the result inside main method
# Activity 5 : Variable Declaration
* You may see compilation error with this activity. Define a class called Test.java
* Define a main method.
* Declare a static variable x of type int at the class level. Declare a non static varaible y of type String at the class level. Run the class. Verify output.
* Define a static block. print the value of x & y inside static block. Run the class. Verify output.
* Define a non-static block. print the value of x & y inside non-static block. Run the class. Verify output.
* Define a static method m1() with void return type. print the value of x & y inside static method. Run the class. Verify output.
* Define a non-static method m2() with void return type. print the value of x & y inside non-static method. Run the class. Verify output.
* print the value of x & y inside main method. Run the class. Verify output.
* Inside main method create object of Test class using new. Test var = new Test();
* call m2() using the reference variable var. Run the class. Verify output.
* Inside main method call m1() without object. Run the class. Verify output.
* What is the default value for x and y you are getting here?
# Activity 6 : Variable Declaration & Intialization
* You may see compilation error with this activity. Define a class called Test.java
* Define a main method.
* Declare a static variable x of type int at the class level. Declare a non static varaible y of type String at the class level. Run the class. Verify output.
* Define a static block. Initialize x = 20; and print x. Run the class. Verify output. 
* Define a static method m1(). Initialize x = 30; and print x. Run the class. Verify output.
* From the main method call m1() without object. Run the class. Verify output.
* Define a non static block. Initialize y = "hello"; and print y. Run the class. Verify output.
* Define a non static method m2(). Initialize y = "bye"; and print y. Run the class. Verify output.
* Inside main method create object of Test using new. Test var = new Test(); From the main method call var.m2(). Run the class. Verify output.
# Activity 7 : Final Variables or Constants
* Define a class called Test.java
* Define a main method.
* Declare a final static variable x of int type. Try to initialize this 2 times.
* Declare a final non static variable y of int type. Try to initialize this 2 times.
